</h2></div></center>
<!-- text -->
  <center><h3>q: how did you become familiar with 3ds hacking?</h3>
  <h4>a: it really started when i got my 3ds in 2011 and was thinking "what else can this do?"</h4>
  <h3>q: how do you have the freetime to do this?</h3>
  <h4>a: summer time, baby. once i'm back in school this site is gonna get a lot less active. :/</h4>
  <h3>q: when do you write these?</h3>
  <h4>a: i usually write one a day, sometimes two a days BUT i will count the second as the guide for the next day unless it's important.</h4>
  <h3>q: can i help write CSS for the site?</h3>
  <h4>a: probably not, unless you show me exactly what it will look like. every time someone has volunteered to do CSS it has broken the design.</h4>
